- 👋 Hi, I’m @simsondej
- 👀 I’m interested in writing code for website projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react.js
- 💞️ I’m not sure what am looking to collaborate on. But if you have a website project you need help on, I'd be interested to hear it.
- 📫 You can reach me on GitHub or Facebook https://www.facebook.com/soupmasterk
